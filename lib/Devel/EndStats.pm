=head1 DESCRIPTION

Devel::EndStats runs in the END block, displaying various statistics about your
program, such as:

=over 4

=item * how many seconds the program ran;

=item * how many required files and total number of lines loaded (from %INC);

=item * etc.

=back

Some notes/caveats:

Devel::EndStats should be loaded before other modules,
for example by running it on the command-line,
as shown in the SYNOPSIS.


=head1 OPTIONS

Some options are accepted. They can be passed via the B<use> statement:

 # from the command line
 % perl -MDevel::EndStats=verbose,1 script.pl

 # from script
 use Devel::EndStats verbose=>1;

or via the DEVELENDSTATS_OPTS environment variable:

 % DEVELENDSTATS_OPTS='verbose=1' perl -MDevel::EndStats script.pl

=over 4

=item * verbose => BOOL (default: 0)

Can also be set via VERBOSE environment variable. If set to true, display more
statistics (like per-module statistics).

=item * sort => STR (default: 'time')

Set how to sort the list of loaded modules ('file' = by file, 'time' = by load
time, 'caller' = by first caller's package, 'order' = by order of loading,
'lines' = by number of lines). Only relevant when 'verbose' is on.

=item * force => BOOL (default: 0)

By default, if BEGIN phase did not succeed, stats will not be shown. This option
forces displaying the stats.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 What is the purpose of this module?

This module might be useful during development. I first wrote this module when
trying to reduce startup overhead of a command line application, by looking at
how many modules the app has loaded and try to avoid loading modules whenever
it's unnecessary.

=head2 Can you add (so and so) information to the stats?

Sure, if it's useful. As they say, (comments|patches) are welcome.

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are many modules on CPAN that can be used to generate dependency
information for your code.
Neil Bowers has written a L<review|http://neilb.org/reviews/dependencies.html>
that covers most of them.

=head1 TODO

* Exclusive instead of inclusive timing for each require.

* Stat: memory usage.

* Stat: system/user time.

* Stat: number of open files (sockets).

* Stat: number of child processes.

* Stat: number of actual code lines (vs blanks, data, comment, POD)

* Stat: number of XS vs PP modules.

* Feature: remember last run's stats, compare with current run.
